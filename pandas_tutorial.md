# Python/Pandas tutorial
## Thurday, May 23rd, 1pm, Science building 1320


### Before coming to the tutorial

Instal Anaconda: 
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/

### Make a new environment
(If you don't know what this is, that's fine. This is a simple way to make sure we all have the same things installed when we start.)

For mac/linux users, go into Terminal. For windows users, go into Anaconda Prompt, which should be installed if you successfully installed Anaconda.

Create an environment with the following command:

conda create --name pdTutorial jupyterlab pandas scipy numpy matplotlib seaborn
